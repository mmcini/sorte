# Minimal Template

This is the minimum LaTeX code needed so that can Pandoc can compile a
document.

## Structure

Following is the minimum structure that is needed. Use it to begin a template
completely from scratch.

```
% When creating a template from scratch
% this is the minimum necessary to compile
\documentclass{article} % or any other class

% Somehow pandoc always uses hyperref
% so it cannot be left out
\usepackage{hyperref}

\begin{document}
$body$
\end{document}
```
